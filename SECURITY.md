- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Environment**: Version, operating system, and configuration details
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept

- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after patch is available

## Security Best Practices

### For System Administrators

#### Production Deployment
- **Always use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Enable SSL/TLS** with strong cipher suites
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for all accounts
- **Implement proper firewall rules** to restrict access
- **Regular security updates** for the underlying operating system
- **Database encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Regular backups** with encryption and off-site storage

#### Access Control
- **Multi-factor authentication** (MFA) for administrative accounts
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
- **Regular access reviews** and user account audits
- **Session management** with appropriate timeouts
- **API key rotation** for external integrations

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Enable audit logging** for all critical operations
- **Monitor failed login attempts** and suspicious activities
- **Set up alerts** for security events
- **Regular log review** and analysis
- **Intrusion detection** systems where appropriate

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** using parameterized queries
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention** with proper output encoding
- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection**
- **Secure file upload** handling with validation
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Strong password policies** enforcement
- **Secure session management** with proper tokens
- **JWT token security** with appropriate expiration
- **API authentication** using secure methods
- **Permission checks** at every endpoint

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption of sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Personal data protection** compliance (GDPR, etc.)
- **Secure data transmission** using TLS 1.2+
- **Data anonymization** for logs and analytics
- **Secure data disposal** procedures

## Security Features
